## Description

We were set out to make a blog, with a theme of our own. I chose to make a blog about latest news and info about games.
Almost everything is made using Wordpress, but fetching it through a REST API from Wordpress. Main focus for the exam 
was to improve on javascript. 



There were some extra focus on:

- Carousels
- Modal images
- A read more button
- Fetching API's
