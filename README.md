## Description

We were set out to make a blog, with a theme of our own. I chose to make a blog about latest news and info about games.
Almost everything is made using Wordpress, but fetching it through a REST API from Wordpress.

There were some extra focus on:

- Carousels
- Modal images
- A read more button
- Fetching API's

## Built With

You can list a the tech stack that you've used over here

## Contributing

Here you can detail any information you want to provide regarding contributing to the project. For big projects you will usually have a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` and link to it, but for smaller projects you can simply include instructions here. These instructions can simply detail the process you want a person to take, such as to make sure to open a pull request so code can be reviewed.
