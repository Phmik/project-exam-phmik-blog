## Description


We were set out to make a blog, with a theme of our own. I chose to make a blog about latest news and info about games.
I chose this theme due to my interests. For me to "perform" better I wanted to have something I have a interest for.
Almost everything is made using Wordpress, but fetching it through a REST API from Wordpress. Main focus for the exam 
was to improve on javascript. 

I wanted to gather all different games into one place, so a user doesn't have to move around to find new info or news on the games 
they are playing. 

There were some extra focus on:

- Carousels
- Modal images
- A read more button
- Fetching API's

One could say I learned more how in depth javascript actually go. What can actually be done with Javascript. Was a fun project!
